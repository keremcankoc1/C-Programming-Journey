# 🚀 My C Programming & F1 Engineering Journey

Welcome! I am **Kerem Can KOÇ** (aka `keremcankoc1`), a Freshman Software Engineering student at **Ankara University**.

This repository documents my progress in learning the **C programming language**. My goal is to combine my passion for **Formula 1** with software engineering to become a **Motorsport Engineer** or **Embedded Systems Engineer**.

Here, I simulate real-world F1 systems, from telemetry processing to race strategy algorithms.

## 📂 Project Structure & Highlights

### 🔋 `telemetry_systems`

**Linked List Implementation.** A robust filtering algorithm designed for embedded systems.
* **Function:** Efficiently removes "noise" or invalid readings (e.g., temperature outliers outside the -100°C to +100°C range) from dynamic memory.
* **Usage:** Ideal for simulating data processing in telemetry systems, ECUs, or environmental monitoring stations.

#### 3. 🏎️ 🗂️ F1 Telemetry System Using Struct (`telemetry_structs.c`)
A structured data management system designed to handle driver telemetry.

#### 4. 📡 Telemetry Converter (`telemetry_converter.c`)
A utility tool designed for data analysis.
* **Function:** Converts race data units (e.g., MPH to KPH, Fahrenheit to Celsius) to standard engineering units.

#### 5. 💻 Telemetry Data Filter (`telemetry_filter.c`)
A C-based Linked List filtering system designed to process and store F1 sector times efficiently.

#### 6. 🛡️ Dynamic ECU Limp Mode Simulator (`sensor_data_management.c`)
**Linked List & File I/O Implementation.** An advanced telemetry parser that mimics a real-world Engine Control Unit (ECU) safety protocol.
* **Features:** Extracts raw CSV sensor data (Vibration, RPM, Power), safely filters out corrupted rows, and applies a "Limp Mode" mathematical transformation (cutting RPM and Power if vibration exceeds critical thresholds). 
* **Tech Stack:** File I/O (`fgets`, `fprintf`, safe parsing via `sscanf`), Linked Lists, and complete Dynamic Memory Management (`calloc`, `free`).
* **Goal:** Demonstrating a robust, crash-resistant ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing embedded system logs without memory leaks.

### 🏎️ `vehicle_dynamics`
*Focus: Physics-based controls and driver inputs.*

#### 1. 🏎️ F1 Launch Control System (`launch_control.c`)
A simulation of the **Red Bull RB21** launch sequence (Start Procedure).
* **Features:** 🌡️ Engine temperature monitoring, **Anti-Stall System** logic, and RPM-based launch feedback.
* **Concepts:** `If-Else` ladders, Input Validation, and state management.

#### 2. 🕹️ Steering Wheel Simulation (`steering_wheel.c`)
A console-based simulation of a **2026-spec F1 steering wheel** interface.
* **Features:**
    * Implementation of **2026 Regulations** (MOM - Manual Override Mode, Active Aero).
    * Pit Limiter logic with return values.
    * Gearbox memory system and Battery (ERS) management.
* **Concepts:** Switch-Case **State Machine**, Infinite Loops (Real-time polling), Global Variables, and Modular Function Design.

#### 3. 💻 Brake-by-Wire (BBW) Simulation (`brake_by_wire_sim.c`)

**Overview:**
A C-based state machine simulation modeling an F1 car's Electronic Brake-by-Wire (BBW) system. This project specifically focuses on the Energy Recovery System (ERS) deployment logic to prevent rear-wheel lock-ups under heavy braking conditions, inspired by real-world telemetries and software anomalies (such as Max Verstappen's Q3 BBW bug).

**Core Engineering Concepts Applied:**
* **Telemetry Data Packaging:** Utilizes C `struct` architectures to bundle vehicle parameters (Speed, Gear, Brake Pressure, Rear Bias, ERS State) simulating continuous data packets.
* **Anomaly Detection & Filtering:** Implements safety guardrails to ignore corrupted sensor spikes (e.g., speed > 380 km/h or negative values).
* **State Machine Logic:** Dynamically toggles ERS mode to intervene and adjust rear brake bias when the vehicle enters a high-risk lock-up window (Gear >= 6, Brake Pressure ~70-80%, Speed >= 275 km/h).
* **Monte Carlo Testing Approach:** Uses randomized, loop-based data generation over 100 iterations to test the algorithm against rare (~1% probability) edge-case scenarios.

**Tech Stack & Standards:**
* Language: Standard C (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`)
* Memory: Safe stack allocation (avoiding dynamic memory/segfaults for real-time safety simulation).
